# Combinoctocat

This is a little _work in progress_ tool to output/display all the possible Octocat combinations
that you can make on [myoctocat.com](https://myoctocat.com/build-your-octocat/). I wanted to write
this after [@jeffrafter](https://github.com/jeffrafter) nerd-sniped me.

## How to develop

I built this using Go version 1.13.4 in macOS.

```sh
make && bin/combinoctocat -in my-octocat.html
```
